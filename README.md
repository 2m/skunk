# Skunk

Skunk is a data access library for Scala + Postgres.

This library is experimental and is changing rapidly. Do not use it.

Still here? Ok.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat" %% "skunk-core" % "0.0.2"
```

For more information see:

- The [documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.tpolecat/skunk-core_2.12) … start with the `skunk` package.
- The [examples](modules/example/src/main/scala).

Please drop a :star: if this project interests you. I need encouragement.
