# Skunk

Skunk is a data access library for Scala + Postgres.

This library is experimental and is changing rapidly. Do not use it.

Still here? Ok.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat" %% "skunk-core" % "0.0.1"
```

For more information see:

- The [documentation](), such as it is.
- The [example](modules/example) project.

Please drop a :star: if this project interests you. I need encouragement.
